## Skills

#### Communication skills

 My experience working as an Office Administrator at Littlediode Ltd refined my communication skills. My duties included regular, direct communication with clients over the phone and email. During weekly meetings, I was able to effectively convey technical changes and ideas to a diverse group of individuals, adapting my delivery style to cater to different levels of understanding. My strong communication skills have also proven invaluable during my training as a software developer. For example, while pair programming during my time at Makers Academy, I was able to effectively communicate my thought process and collaborate with my partner to achieve our goals. My strong communication skills, combined with my passion for problem-solving and technical abilities, make me a valuable asset in any team.

#### Leadership experience

I have a strong leadership background, honed from my experience as a martial arts teacher for children aged 5-13. In this role, I quickly realized that taking an authoritarian approach with the class was not the most effective way to lead. Instead, I decided to lead by example, demonstrating each move and inspiring the children to give their best efforts. My approach paid off, as I received positive feedback from the parents and the children were eager to participate in every class. This experience highlights my ability to effectively lead and motivate individuals towards a common goal.

#### Adept learner

I am an exceptional learner, with the ability to quickly grasp new concepts and apply them to practical solutions. This was demonstrated in September 2020, when I first began teaching myself how to code. My manager at Littlediode was impressed by my progress and asked me to write a program that would automate certain tasks and increase efficiency. To complete this task, I had to learn several new concepts, including SQL basics, working with CSV files, and the Python OS library. The program I wrote was a success, saving my manager hours of time and showcasing my aptitude for learning and problem-solving. I believe my ability to quickly learn new concepts and apply them to practical solutions will serve me well in my future role as a Junior Software Developer, due to the fast paced and constantly evolving nature of the industry.
